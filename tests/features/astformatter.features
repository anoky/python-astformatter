Feature: Generate proper Python code
    In order to be able to transform and recreate Python modules,
    as a software developer,
    I want the ASTFormatter class to be able to generate proper
    Python code for any given AST tree.
    
    Scenario Outline: Basic AST structures should work.
        Given I have parsed an AST tree from "<source input>",
         when I transform the AST tree to source,
         then the output should include "<output snippet>".
     
    Examples:
        | source input                                          | output snippet                                            |
        | def foo(x): pass                                      | def foo(x):\n    pass                                     |
        | class foo(object): pass                               | class foo(object):                                        |
        | return x                                              | return x                                                  |
        | delete foo                                            | delete foo                                              	|
        | foo = x                                               | foo = x                                                   |
        | foo += y                                              | foo += y                                                  |

    Scenario Outline: Operator precedence should be taken into account
        Given I have parsed an AST tree from "<source input>",
         when I transform the AST tree to source,
         then the output should include "<output snippet>".
     
    Examples:
        | source input                                          | output snippet                                            |
        | x + y * z                                             | x + y * z                                                 |
        | (x + y) * z                                           | (x + y) * z                                               |
        | x + (y * z)                                           | x + y * z                                                 |
